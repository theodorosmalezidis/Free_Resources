I had nothing to do with this field at first and  didn’t know where to start, but free resources helped me gain knowledge and build a solid foundation. Below, I will list these free resources as organized as possible, hoping they will help you as well, while keeping the following in mind:

- Concinstency and discipline is key. Where there is will there are results.
- You don’t have to follow tutorials word for word. Keep what you find useful, learn, and experiment. Take what you find valuable from each video or course you watch, and then move on to the next.
- You will face challenges, and in some cases, you’ll have to find the solutions yourself and resolve any problems that arise. Don't give up—it takes persistence and resourcefulness (that is how you learn and grow).
- And in my language, we often say, 'Repetition is the mother of learning. Repeat and practise again and again.

At least, this is what I have done—or rather, what I’m still doing—because I’m still learning and evolving.
(I will try to update the lists of resources frequently)
